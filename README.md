## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### My file won't load
- **Check the file format**: Make sure it's a Fallout Shelter save file
- **Try both formats**: If `.sav` doesn't work, try exporting as `.json` first
- **Check file size**: Corrupted saves may be 0 bytes or unusually small

### Changes aren't saving
- Click the **"💾 Download Save"** button (browser can't modify files directly)
- Choose format: `.sav` for in-game use, `.json` for further editing
- Replace your original save file with the downloaded one

### Game doesn't recognize my edited save
- Make sure you saved as `.sav` format (encrypted)
- Keep the original filename
- Place it in the correct save folder
- Restart the game completely

### Validation warnings appear
- Read the warnings carefully
- Minor warnings are usually safe to ignore
- Critical errors may corrupt your save – fix before downloading
